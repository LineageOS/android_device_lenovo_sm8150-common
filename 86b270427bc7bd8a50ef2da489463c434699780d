Oh well, I think we should just go for AOSP WFD for meow and maybe in the future if we can find a solution that works for Lenovo sm8150 without using BSP stuff? We can go in that direction.",

      "message": "Interesting, maybe it changed for A12? I did have a commit about it like a year ago on LineageOS 18.1 but I never merged it since it didn\u0027t make a difference on WFD and at the time it seemed like a debugging prop so I might have to try it again then with lemonade\u0027s stack or maybe sweet since that\u0027s sm6150 and it has A12 so for sure it would be 100% compatible to sm8150 since they\u0027re the same kernel version too\n\nhttps://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/android_device_lenovo_sm8150-common/+/309739",
